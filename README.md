# Getting Started

Publishes datasources that have a global extent or are available for many/most countries.

See `project/datasources.json` for the full list and metadata.

## Subdivided datasources

The `bundle-features` command is broken in geoprocessing version 3.0 and up.  You will need `npm install` v2.2.0 of the geoprocessing library as a dependency of this project in order to publish subdivided datasources using the `bundle-features` command.  Then can then switch back when you're done.  This will be fixed in a future release.
